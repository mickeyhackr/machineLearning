A simple model which performs a regressive supervised learning based on the data (Runs, Ball Faced, Innings, Position) to analyse Virat Kohli's run scored using multivariate regression algorithm. In this case Ball Faced and Runs might not be independent to each other, but the model assumes them as two independent features. 
We have obtained the data from ESPN.COM for analysis.
